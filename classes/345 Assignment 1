Assignment 1

1. Proof: Since B is in (V or (Sigma))+, we know it is a sentence of variables and terminals that is not empty. A is in V which means A is a symbol with length 1 in the alphabet of variables. Given aAy -> aBy, we know a and y stay the same length because they are unchanged. |B| can never be greater than |A| because A is a single symbol, whereas B is either 1 symbol or more. Thus, if we let aAy = x and aBy = w. x -> w will always satisfy |x| <= |w|. Because all productions are of the form aAy -> aBy, each production is increasing in length.
